5. Different ways to do String concatenation
6. Data type conversions
7. Different ways of using print and using end
8. Program to find logical operators and bitwise operators
9. print random numbers
10. Description: Write a program to check whether a number is even or odd.
    Example:
    Input: number = 4
    Output: Even
    Explanation: Since 4 is divisible by 2, it is an even number.
11. Print the last digit of a number
12. Check the status of the flag
    Given two integer variables a and b, and a boolean variable flag. The task is to check the status and return accordingly.
    Return True for the following cases:
    Either a or b (not both) is non-negative and the flag is false.
    Both a and b are negative and the flag is true.
13. Check if tuple is distinct or not
    Given a tuple arr , print "True" if all elements of tuple are different otherwise print "False".
14. Given a tuple arr with distinct elements and an integer x, find the index position of x. Assume to have x in the tuple always. Print the index (0-based).
    Examples:
    Input: arr = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), x = 3
    Output: 2
15. Given two integers d and n. Where d is the day, out of 7 days of the week, d varies from 0 to 6 as shown below.
    0 - Sunday 1 - Monday 2 - Tuesday 3 - Wednesday 4 - Thursday 5 - Friday 6 - Saturday
    You have to return the index for the day which is n days before the given day d.
16. Given a dictionary, and a list of queries(keys), you have to find and print the value of each query from the dictionary if present else it prints "None".
    Input:
    dict = {1:"abc", 2: "cde", 3: "fgh"}
    query = [2, 3, 4]
    Output:
    cde
    fgh
    None
17. Given a temperature in celsius C. You have to convert it in Fahrenheit and viceversa
18. Given a number n , subtract one from it using bitwise operations.
19. Given a decimal number n, return its binary equivalent.
20. You are given a string s, you need to print its characters at even indices(index starts at 0).
21. You are given a number n. The number n can be negative or positive. If n is negative, print numbers from n to 0 by adding 1 to n in the neg function. If positive, print numbers from n-1 to 0 by         subtracting 1 from n in the pos function.
    Input:
    n = 0
    Output:
    already Zero
    Input:
    n = 4
    Output:
    3 2 1 0
22. You are given a string str, you need to return True if  the words "cat" and "hat" appear same number of times in str, otherwise return False.
    Note: str contains only lowercase English alphabets.
    Input:
    str = catinahat
    Output:
    True
    Explanation:
    cat and hat both are present
    1 number of times.
23. print calculator by taking two input
24. Write a program to check if a given year is a leap year.
    Example:
    Input: year = 2020
    Output: Leap Year
    Explanation: 2020 is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is divisible by 400, so it is a leap year.
25. Write a program to determine if a number is prime.
    Example:
    Input: number = 7
    Output: Prime
    Explanation: 7 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, so it is a prime number.
26. Create the multiplication table from 1 to 10 for a given number n and return the table as an array.
    Examples:
    Input: n = 9
    Output: 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90
27. Given two integers n and m (m != 0). The problem is to find the number closest to n and divisible by m. If there is more than one such number, then output the one having the maximum absolute value.
    Input: n = -15, m = 6
    Output: -18
    Explanation: Both -12 and -18 are closest to -15 and divisible by 6, but -18 has the maximum absolute value. So, output is -18.
28. You are given a cubic dice with 6 faces. All the individual faces have a number printed on them. The numbers are in the range of 1 to 6, like any ordinary dice. You will be provided with a face of     this cube, your task is to guess the number on the opposite face of the cube.
    Input: n = 6
    Output: 1
    Explanation: For dice facing number 6 opposite face will have the number 1.
